            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                As the deployment of small-scale rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems accelerates, transmission system operators (TSOs) 
                face growing challenges in accessing reliable and comprehensive data on installed PV capacity. 
                In France, 99% of PV grid connections correspond to rooftop systems connected to distribution networks. 
                Yet, the accuracy and uncertainty of national PV registries remain undocumented, limiting their use in 
                critical grid operations. In this context of sustained growth, timely and verifiable data are essential 
                to ensure forecasting accuracy and secure grid management. We introduce DeepPVMapper, a deep learning 
                pipeline trained on aerial orthoimagery to detect rooftop PV systems and estimate their installed 
                capacity, tilt and azimuth angles. Applied at the French national scale, the method identifies over 
                500,000 installations and generates a geospatial dataset to assess and audit the completeness of 
                official registries. This study focuses on empirically evaluating the added value of Earth Observation 
                and deep learning methods in practice. Using spatial aggregation and inter-source consensus metrics, we 
                analyze how DeepPVMapper outputs align or diverge from the French TSO registry. Results reveal strong 
                correlations in periurban areas, suggesting that existing registries are generally well-structured at aggregate 
                scales. However, we also identify persistent gaps in rural zones where EO-based mapping highlights systematic 
                omissions or errors. This work demonstrates how remote sensing acts as an independent, scalable lens to benchmark 
                and improve the quality of PV datasets. It contributes to assessing the operational relevance of EO-based tools for 
                energy system monitoring where direct observability is limited.

                        The algorithm processes high-resolution aerial imagery through a two-stage pipeline:

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Classification Stage:</strong> Aerial tiles are divided into patches and classified to detect PV panels</li>
                        <li><strong>Segmentation Stage:</strong> Detected regions are precisely segmented to extract polygon boundaries</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The extracted polygons are converted to geolocated GeoJSON files, and system characteristics 
                        (tilt, orientation, installed power, surface area) are computed using auxiliary data sources. 
                        The system applies various filters to ensure quality, including restrictions to installations 
                        under 36 kWc located on rooftops.

                The DeepPVMapper system has been validated against the French national registry of installations (RNI), 
                demonstrating reliable performance in mapping distributed rooftop photovoltaic systems. The algorithm 
                successfully processes large-scale aerial imagery datasets and generates comprehensive inventories 
                of PV installations with detailed characteristics.
